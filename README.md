# Structural Defect Detection using Computer Vision

Manual inspection of structural defects such as cracks is time-consuming,
subjective, and prone to human error. This project automates structural
defect detection using image-based machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Traditional structural inspections rely heavily on manual observation,
which can lead to missed defects and delayed maintenance. An automated
computer vision-based approach can improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of structural surfaces categorized
into defect and non-defect classes. Images were preprocessed and augmented
to improve model generalization.

## Approach
1. Image preprocessing and resizing
2. Data augmentation
3. Model training using machine learning / deep learning techniques
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Results
The trained model successfully detects structural defects from images
with promising accuracy, demonstrating potential real-world usability.

## Live Application
The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
